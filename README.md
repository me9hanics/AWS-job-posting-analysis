# Job posting analysis with AWS: Scraping the karriere.at website for job postings + Using AWS services to extract relevant key phrases

A project collecting job postings from scraping websites such as [Karriere.at](karriere.at), extracting information such as description keywords, running AWS Cloud Computing tools combined with other NLP methods to obtain valuable insights.

The implementation has been updated to support easier implementation of scraping other websites; the core of this is the very general `BaseScraper` class - each website has a separate scraper class inherited from the base class. The base class has methods that covers various scenarios: when only HTTP(S) requests are needed to gather the data, when JavaScript content has to be loaded (using Selenium as a headless browser), scrolling and loading new postings, pressing buttons and closing popups.

The AWS key phrase extraction analysis was used on ~300 job postings from karriere.at, and none from other websites (as scraping solutions for those were not yet implemented at the time of analysis). The pipeline deals with and makes use of the fact that majority of the postings are written in German.

## Description

The project consists of two main parts:

- Data collection: Scraping and processing job postings from the karriere.at website, in specific categories (e.g. Data Science and Vienna). Specifically, we use the job titles and descriptions.
- Key phrases extraction with AWS servives: Using Amazon Comprehend's `detect_key_phrases` and `detect_dominant_language` methods to extract key phrases from the job descriptions.

For improving key phrase extraction, I filtered out stopwords (with `nltk` library methods) and detected German phrases (using the `langdetect` library). The results are plotted and manually evaluated.

## Why not LinkedIn / Indeed?

LinkedIn and Indeed have indicated in their `robots.txt` that they do not allow web scraping of their job postings. If you are not familiar with the concept of `robots.txt`, it's basically a programmatic ruleset provided by the website provider intended for bots that gather information from website, defining which subpages are allowed to be inspected and used for information processing.<br>
(Indeed does not allow the `/Jobs` subdirectory to be scraped. Meanwhile, LinkedIn might [allow scraping to some limits for any user](https://evaboot.com/blog/does-linkedin-allow-scraping#3-linkedin-scraping-limitations), it requires logging in with a real account to view job postings, making it not worth the risk considering their strict policies and [powerful prevention teams](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/trust-and-safety/using-deep-learning-to-detect-abusive-sequences-of-member-activi).)

We have to suffice to karriere.at, and enterprise websites, those do not disallow our bot's data collection.

A reasonable goal in the future is to collect a set of companies hiring in relevant fields, check their website if their `robots.txt` allows scraping, and using the implemented scraping tools to collect job postings from each website. For such reasons, much of the code is designed to be modular, instead of hardcoded and specific to karriere.at.

## Data collection

*Note: the data collection since has been updated to not use Selenium for the URL collection and general data collection part, and likely will be improved to only use requests to get description as well. See the `KarriereATScraper().gather_data()` method.*

Scraping job postings with descriptions from the karriere.at website is in some retrospect simple, but nontrivial.<br>
There seem to be no restrictions to even HTTP requests with no authentication, and often basic web scraping tricks work to gather some information. However, the simple methods do not always return desired results (especially not all postings, just a subsection), making it preferable to use more advanced tools. I used `Selenium` to render webpages and scrape instead - even for job posting subpages a simple request will not return the full HTML, thus the need use a headless browser like Selenium.

We cannot open job postings directly as those have IDs in their URLs. The IDs can be found through firstly opening category pages and gathering the IDs from there. Afterwards, we can open each job posting page and scrape the description.

Based on this, the pipeline consists of two parts with the following steps:

**Part 1**: Gathering job posting IDs
- Constructing the to-be-scraped URLs from the base URL and categories - this is quite straightforward as the website uses a simple URL structure.
- Opening each URL with `Selenium`,
- Detecting if a cookie popup is present, and closing it
- In a loop, till no more job postings are loaded:
    - Scrolling to the bottom of the page to get to the "load more" button
    - Clicking the "load more" button until no more job postings are loaded
- Scraping the full HTML, containing all job postings in the category
- Processing: Extracting the job posting IDs and titles from the HTML; descriptions are not yet available.

**Part 2**: Gathering job posting descriptions
- For each job posting ID, open the respective URL
- Wait for the page to load, optionally close the cookie popup
- Scrape the full HTML, containing the job posting description
- Processing: Extract the text from the correct HTML elements, strip it from HTML tags
- Save the job postings with ID, title, description (and base url) to a JSON file. 

Here is an image representing various steps of the process:

![Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/me9hanics/AWS-job-posting-analysis/refs/heads/main/imgs/process.png)

The CSS selectors for the popup closing (`.onetrust-close-btn-handler`), the "load more" button (`.m-loadMoreJobsButton__button`), and the job posting elements (`div.m-jobsListItem__container div.m-jobsListItem__dataContainer h2.m-jobsListItem__title a.m-jobsListItem__titleLink`) were found via the Edge browser's (Chrome) developer tools, among other things. The URL IDs contain the job posting IDs, which are also stored in this jobs-list-item element, alongside the title (but not the description).

A gist is available [here](https://gist.github.com/me9hanics/65175381063f7fe2e27d6a1dca53e6cb), containing the important methods. The repository containing the full code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/me9hanics/AWS-job-posting-analysis) - note that this includes a notebook instead of the `karriereat.py` file.<br>
The most specific / high level methods are in the `karriereat.py` file (see gist), the methods used inside these functions can be found in the [`methods` modules folder](https://github.com/me9hanics/AWS-job-posting-analysis/tree/main/methods).<br>
As said before, the pipeline is designed to be extendable to other websites with desirably low effort, hence options in the methods such as pre-load and post-load waiting times, keeping or closing driver instances, and so on.

After running the pipeline and saving the job postings with descriptions to a JSON file, we can proceed to the key phrase extraction process. Here are some statistics, that we will later rely on for the extraction, and the cost calculations:

```
Number of postings: 462
Total number of characters in descriptions: 1783171
Average number of characters per description (excluding 0-length descriptions): 3876.46
Total number of words: 226275
Average number of words (excluding 0-length descriptions): 491.90
```

Not all of the postings will be used for our analysis, and different languages need to be handled differently. These are steps for the key phrase extraction process.

## Key phrases extraction attempts

We would like to extract terms that are appear more frequently in these job descriptions than expected by chance (analogous to the idea of TF-IDF), and are relevant for our job search - we are interested in key phrases that frequently appear in the job postings that are relevant to us.

On the simplest level, this can be achieved by at least two separate methods: locally using a library such as `spaCy`, or using a cloud service provider's strong service, such as Amazon Comprehend. It's worthy to look at the difference between the results of these two methods.

### Comparison of Amazon Comprehend and spaCy

Let's take the following example job description:

```
description = "One bank.  Many career paths. #makeITmatter Conversational AI Specialist\

```

With a simple use of Amazon Comprehend (`response = comprehend.detect_key_phrases(Text=description, LanguageCode="en")`), we gather the following key phrases, with their respective confidence levels (frequency can also be gathered). This is not something, that spaCy provides. Let's compare the results:

```
Amazon Comprehend:

- One bank: 99.42% confidence
- Many career paths: 86.96% confidence
- AI: 51.70% confidence

- e.g. AI models: 96.60% confidence
- audio data: 99.92% confidence
- call centers: 99.89% confidence
...

```

```
spaCy:

'AI': 10,
'models': 3,
'bank': 2,
'Erste': 2,
'Digital': 2,
'solutions': 2,
'Science': 2,
'career': 1,

'humans)Location': 1,
'Vienna': 1,
'Wien': 1,
'AustriaWorking': 1,
'Hours': 1,
'fulltime_permanentDivision': 1,
'Data2BusinessCompany': 1,
...
```

It seems, that spaCy not only picks up terms that are not even close to being key phrases, but can only look at words, not phrases. This gives a clear advantage to Amazon Comprehend, which can detect key phrases among providing confidence levels too - however those are not reliable. The processing took 44.1 seconds for the 462 job postings, which is managable, but not as fast as expected.<br>
We see, that both methods focus on many terms that are not relevant to our search - this might be a fundamental issue, that is hard to solve. In the next steps, we use Amazon Comprehend's methods to attempt to improve key phrase extraction.

Important to not that while many of the job descriptions are in German, the keywords that we really care about are typically in English - this will come as a useful filter later on.


## Key phrase "mining" with Amazon Comprehend, and analysis

The following code is used to first load the descriptions, then select only a relevant subset of 352 postings of them (which also reduces computing costs by 24%), then using Amazon Comprehend to first determine the language of a job description with `detect_dominant_language` (fast and cheap mode of improvement, as this information comes as input into the next method) on a small section of the description, and then extract key phrases with `detect_key_phrases`. Knowing, that these initial results are poor, we make 2 additional attempts to filter out unwanted key phrases: firstly by removing phrases including stopwords (provided by the `nltk` library), and then by detecting with a simple method from the `langdetect` library if a keyphrase or keyword is written in German, filtering out German key phrases. The results after both improvements are plotted.

```

The use of the two libraries could be replaced via AWS methods - we could detect the language of the key phrases as we did before, and filtering stopwords is also possible with AWS. The main reason why these were utilized is cost - e.g. every separate request to detect the language of a key phrase costs as much money as requesting detecting language of a 300 character text, and since we can have many keywords and key phrases, that would not be feasible.

If we first try to just list the keywords, and key phrases (phrases with more than one word) that appear in the job descriptions, the most frequent key phrases list includes too many German terms. Without filtering, every common keyword is just a frequent word. If we filter out stopwords, we already get better results, with some actual key phrases appearing:

![Most common keywords and keyphrases (352 job descriptions) - corrected for stopwords](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/me9hanics/AWS-job-posting-analysis/refs/heads/main/imgs/keyphrases.png)

However, this is still far from desirable. Another attempt would be to filter out key phrases that appear to be in German - to save costs, we can use the `langdetect` library to detect the language of the key phrases (without increasing AWS costs), and only keep the English ones. This is a simple, but slow method.

After filtering out German key phrases:

![Most common keywords and keyphrases (352 job descriptions) - corrected for stopwords, filter German keywords](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/me9hanics/AWS-job-posting-analysis/refs/heads/main/imgs/keyphrases_nongerman.png)

We again see significant improvement, but this is still far from desirable.<br>
This hints at researching methods that can understand the context of job posting descriptions, extracting key phrases based on text context. In modern NLP, this could be achieved with large language models, however is also a challenging and computationally expensive task.

## Conclusion

We (I) have successfully designed a pipeline to scrape job postings of certain categories from the karriere.at website, bypassing all issues and extracted key phrases from the job descriptions using Amazon Comprehend. The initial results were disappointing due to many unwanted terms appearing among the processed key phrases, thus attempts were made to filter out some these false positives. As the best solutions are still far from practical usage, the next steps would be to research methods that can understand the context of job posting descriptions, as utilizing text context seems to be necessary to solve such problems.

## Costs

We only used the Amazon Comprehend service, which has standard pricing: *"NLP requests are measured in units of 100 characters, with a 3 unit (300 character) minimum charge per request"* (see the last section? this is why we could not use the `detect_dominant_language` method for each keyword, and why we used 299 words long text sections for translation).<br>
The pricing is as follows: Key Phrase Extraction/Translation:	$0.0001 per unit (under 10M units)

We can utilize the fact that on average, our job descriptions are 3876.46 characters long, i.e. 39 units.<br>
We have two sources of costs:

-Small-scale translation: 3 units (299 characters) * 352 job postings * $0.0001/unit ~ 0.1 USD
-Description key phrase extraction: On average, a description is 3900 characters long - we can guess a price of 39 units * 352 job postings * $0.0001/unit ~ 1.37 USD

Running the above code would cost roughly 1.47 USD per run.

Whilst not reoccurring costs, initial costs while developing also need to be considered:

Initial, small scale tests cost:<br>
1213 characters long text - 13 units -> 0.0013 USD

One time run on the full dataset:<br>
39 units * 462 job postings * $0.0001/unit ~ 1.80 USD

Two previous runs on the filtered dataset:<br>
2 * 39 units * 352 job postings * $0.0001/unit ~ 2.74 USD

**Overall costs**: 0.1 + 1.37 + 1.80 + 2.74 ~ 6.01 USD.
